Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is often reflected in the following EEG markers:

- Elevated Theta power and reduced Alpha power, especially in frontal and parietal regions
- Suppressed Beta activity, suggesting cognitive slowing
- Anomalies should be interpreted based on severity (e.g., Alpha ratio < 0.7), the number of affected bands, and distribution across channels

⚠️ Synthetic Data Context:
- In synthetic data, abnormalities are generated deliberately and consistently — they should be treated as *reliable evidence*
- If two or more anomalies are present, assume they reflect a clinically significant pattern
- Do not hesitate to classify as **MCI** when multiple bands show deviations

Classification Guidance:
- Classify as **MCI** if:
  - Two or more abnormal EEG markers are present, or
  - One anomaly is strong and widespread

- Classify as **Control** if:
  - All EEG ratios are within or near normal range (e.g., Alpha > 1.0), and no abnormalities are detected

- Classify as **Needs clinical review** only when:
  - One mild or borderline anomaly is present, and it's unclear whether it's significant

- Elevated Theta power and reduced Alpha power, especially in frontal and parietal regions
- Suppressed Beta activity, suggesting cognitive slowing
- Anomalies should be interpreted based on severity (e.g., Alpha ratio < 0.7), the number of affected bands, and distribution across channels

Classification Guidance:
- Classify as **MCI** if:
  - Two or more abnormal EEG markers are present, or
  - One anomaly is strong and widespread

- Classify as **Control** if:
  - All EEG ratios are within or near normal range (e.g., Alpha > 1.0), and no abnormalities are detected

- Classify as **Needs clinical review** only when:
  - One mild or borderline anomaly is present, and it's unclear whether it's significant


EEG Summary:
EEG Summary:
Alpha power is globally reduced.
Theta levels are normal.
Theta/Alpha ratio: 3.12
Theta/Beta ratio: 0.70


Task:
Based on the EEG summary above, assess the subject's cognitive status.

Respond in the following format:
Conclusion: [MCI / Control / Needs clinical review]  
Explanation: [Concise justification referring to EEG patterns]

Use confident ""MCI"" classification if multiple markers are abnormal.
Avoid using ""review"" unless findings are ambiguous or borderline.
","Conclusion: MCI  
Explanation: The EEG summary indicates a globally reduced Alpha power, which is a significant marker for MCI. Although Theta levels are normal, the elevated Theta/Alpha ratio of 3.12 suggests a notable imbalance between these bands. The presence of these two abnormal markers (reduced Alpha power and elevated Theta/Alpha ratio) aligns with the criteria for classifying as MCI, as multiple EEG markers are abnormal.",MCI,high
